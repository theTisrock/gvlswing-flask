WELCOME PAGE CMS execution plan

    Instead of storing data with variable contents in a database that is restricted
    to certain datatypes, I have elected to read the landing page content about the main
    event from a JSON file.

    https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html

    json.dumps(), json.dump() => Python object to JSON
    json.loads(), json.load() => JSON object to Python

    This decision is intended to remove complexity from storing and accessing the data. I will also allow admins
    to edit content without too much fear of messing it up in the database.

    1. Constructed a JSON file modeled after the front page that is already built.
    2. Construct a method that reads in the JSON data from the file and returns it.
        - use jsonify and json libraries
    3. Before loading the index.html page, read-in the JSON data
    4. Pass JSON to the template.
    5. Apply passed-in JSON to the template.
    DONE.
